    </p>

    <p>The Computer Science and Engineering program combines a rigorous education in computer science with
        added emphasis on the physical and architectural underpinnings of modern computer system design. With a
        background that spans computer science and computer engineering, our graduates are able to address
        computing systems across the hardware-software spectrum. The objective of the degree is to produce 
        a well-rounded and well-balanced graduate who can use Computer Science tools to solve real world problems.
        In designing the course, the requirements of IEEE and standards laid down by American, Canadian, British 
        and Indian universities and institutes have been taken into consideration.The aim of the Department 
        of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is to enable innovation through research, advance educational 
        programs in CSE and ICT fields and facilitate enrichment of CSE human resources- the students, faculty 
        and staff, thereby establishing itself as a center of excellence at the national and international level.
